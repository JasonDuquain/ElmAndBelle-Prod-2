fix the services modal(s) from scaling down to zero on page load!!

THIS WAS ADDED AND THE JS CLICK WAS REMOVED TO GET IT WORKING ON MOBILE EVEN WITH HTML HAVING SCROLL-BEHAVIOR: SMOOTH...THE SCROLL UP ON MOBILE IS NOT SMOOTH BUT IT AT LEAST WORKS:

<button class="js-btt-btn" onclick="window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })">
    <i class="js-btt-btn-icon fa fa-chevron-up"></i>
</button>


POSSIBLE TO LAZY LOAD THE SQUARE APP FROM LOADING RIGHT AWAY??


ADDED OVERFLOW-X: HIDDEN TO THE BODY..REMOVE IF ANY ISSUES
