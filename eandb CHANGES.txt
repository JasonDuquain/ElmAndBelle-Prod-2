                            I highly recommend Jen to be your hair colorist and stylist. She is amazingly talented at cuts and color that will match and flatter your skin tone and your eyes. Being her neighbor it is beyond convenient to be able to go to her salon in her home on early evenings during the work week. I am thrilled with my cut and color. She offers everything and her pricing is more competitive than what you will pay at salons in the area. Book your appointment with Jen!!!

                            It's been a long time since I've walked out of a salon with a cut and color that I loved. Jenn did an amazing job and really took the time to understand what I was looking for. I'm so happy with my new cut and color! I loved the individualized attention she gave me and her flexibility with scheduling. Looking forward to going back.

                            Jen is great! Nice, cozy environment to relax in and be pampered! Next time I’m bringing a bottle of wine! came in not really knowing exactly what I wanted, but she figured it out. I’m always hesitant about cuts because I have curly hair and I’ve ended up looking like a triangle/Bozo the clown too many times, but she has curly hair too so she knows what to do... I love the color she did and felt her sincerity on wanting to make sure I was happy. I also love leaving a salon with straight hair, because I don’t ever really do it myself. Overall great experience and will definitely be back!

                            Couldn't recommend Elm &amp; Belle more. Jennifer is fantastic. I need some color (no cut this time), and she perfectly matched exactly what I was looking for. She's extremely knowledgable about every product she recommends and why she's using that specific product for your hair. Her hours are very convenient, her salon is beautiful, her rates are competitive, and she's so much fun to hang out and chat with while you're getting beautified. My husband was so impressed with my experience that he's booking his own appointment!

                            Jenn is amazing! I wasn’t sure what to do with all my hair to make it more manageable. Jenn was wonderful! She came up with an idea that I just love. She executed exactly what I wanted...even without being sure what that was exactly! So excited about my new go to place and person!!
